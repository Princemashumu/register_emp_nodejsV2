The Employee Management System is a React application designed to manage employee data, including authentication and CRUD operations for employee records.

## ⚠️ Common Issues and Solutions  

### 1. ❌ **Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useContext')**  

**Issue:** This error often occurs when there is a problem with React Router or the context API not being properly set up or imported.  

**🔧 Solution:**  
- Ensure that you have `react-router-dom` installed and correctly imported in your `App.js`.  
- Check if you are wrapping your application with `<Router>` properly and that all components using hooks like `useContext` or `useNavigate` are properly nested within the `<Router>` component.  

### 2. ❌ **Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useRef')**  

**Issue:** This error usually indicates that a component is trying to use `useRef` but is not within a valid React context or the component import might be missing.  

**🔧 Solution:**  
- Verify that `react` and `react-dom` are installed and up-to-date in your `package.json`.  
- Check that all components and hooks are imported from the correct packages.  
- Make sure the component using `useRef` is correctly imported and used within the application.  

### 3. ⚠️ **Invalid or incorrect imports**  

**Issue:** This can occur if there are mismatches or typos in import paths or file names.  

**🔧 Solution:**  
- Double-check the import paths in `App.js` and other files to ensure they match the actual file names and locations.  
- Make sure all components (e.g., `Login`, `LoginPage`, `EmployeeData`, `DeletedEmployeeTable`, `AddEmployeeModal`) are correctly imported from their respective paths.  

### 4. 🔄 **Login and Signup Navigation Issues**  

**Issue:** Users may encounter problems navigating to the login or signup pages.  

**🔧 Solution:**  
- Ensure that routes are correctly set up in the `Routes` component.  
- Verify that `Navigate` is used correctly to redirect users based on their authentication status.  
- Check that `handleLogin` and `handleSignup` functions are correctly passed and used in the `Login` and `LoginPage` components.  

### 5. 💾 **Local Storage Issues**  

**Issue:** Problems with persisting or retrieving data from local storage.  

**🔧 Solution:**  
- Ensure `localStorage` is used correctly in `useEffect` hooks to save and load data.  
- Confirm that data is being serialized and deserialized properly using `JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse()`.  

### 6. 🖼 **Modal Display Problems**  

**Issue:** The `AddEmployeeModal` may not be showing or closing correctly.  

**🔧 Solution:**  
- Check that the `showModal` state is correctly set and passed to the `AddEmployeeModal` component.  
- Ensure `AddEmployeeModal` has proper logic to handle the `onSave` and `onClose` functions.

## 📁 Project Structure  

- 📂 **src/**: Source files for the application.  
- 📂 **components/**: Contains reusable components like `Login`, `LoginPage`, `EmployeeData`, and `DeletedEmployeeModal`.  
- 📂 **pages/**: Contains page-specific components such as `Home`, `AddEmployeeModal`, and `DeletedEmployeeTable`.  
- 📄 **App.js**: Main component for routing and state management.  
- 📄 **index.js**: Entry point of the application.  

## 🛤 Routing  

Routes are managed with `react-router-dom`. Key routes include:  

- 🔑 `/login`: Login page for unauthenticated users.  
- 📝 `/signup`: Signup page for creating new accounts.  
- 🏠 `/home`: Home page for authenticated users.  
- 📋 `/employeedata`: Page to manage employee records.  
- 🗑 `/deletedemployees`: Page to view deleted employee records.  

## 🔐 Authentication  

Authentication state is managed with React's `useState` hook. The `isAuthenticated` state controls access to different routes.  

## 💾 Local Storage  

Employee data and deleted employee records are persisted in local storage. Data is loaded from and saved to local storage using `useEffect`.
